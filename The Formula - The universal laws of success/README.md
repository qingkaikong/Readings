This will keep the notes from the book I just finish - [The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success](https://www.amazon.com/The-Formula/dp/0316526479/) by Altert-Laszlo Barabasi. 

## Chapter 3 
* Since success is a collective phenomenon, measured by how our community reacts to a performance, it's impossible to understand the phenomenon of success without also observing the network it takes place within. 
* Today, many art historians consider *Fountain* to be the single most important work of modern art. 
* One person's trash is another person's treasure.
* Performance drives success, but when performance can't be measured, networks drive success. 
* We did so by mapping the unseen links that shape how artists move among galleries and museums. 
* If a gallery sees that an artist is exhibited by other institutions whose instincts it trusts, it's far more likely to take that artist on. 
* If your work is exhibited at one of these hubs, it's as if you hop onto a merry-go-round of success, looping around and around to other major institutions with ease. 
* But you'll be trapped there - none of them can teleport you to the mainland, where the action is. 
* To be successful as an artist, you have to have your work shown by a gallery for the same reason, say, that Dior never sold his originals from a counter in Woolworth's
* The dirty but open secret in art world is that once you've made it, it's in everyone's interest to keep you "made". 
* It's a pyramid scheme that pushes prices in only one direction. 
* While the art world may lack performance metrics, it doesn't lack order. 
* They'd started at teh bottom but managed to break through, finishing at the top. 
* Instead, they cast a wide net, as the saying goes, reaching outward and showing at institutions of widely varying location and reputation. 
* Rather than remaining stubbornly loyal to a few exhibition spaces, they surveyed their options and took advantage of a wide range of opportunities. 
* But climbing the corporate ladder isn't realistic if we can't prove we are the best at what we do. 
* **The second law** Performance is bounded, but success is unbounded. 

## Chapter 2
* She could have turned to Google to figure out how many of us really care about a player, as we'd done for the German pilots. 
* There was only one way to interpret her results: Success in tennis is determined by a single factor - strong athleticism. 
* Rather, performance and ambition, working in tandem, would determine his future success
* It's your daughter who makes Boston Latin into the elite school it is. 
* The school doesn't make you great, you are great to begin with! 
* It's performance and ambition - where she thinks she belongs - that determine your daughter's success. 

## Chapter 1
* So they proposed a simple but clever solution. They used Google hits, measuring how many times people searched for these pilots by name on the Internet. 
* At first glance, the Red Baron's legacy confirms the popular assumption that strong performance leads to success. 
* But it's a mere 1.6 percent of the total. Pocket change in the larger scheme. Yet he generated 27 percent of the German aces' Google hits. 
* Seemingly, it's the last person who makes a discovery that really matters, not the first. 
* Your success isn't about you and your performance. It's about us and how we perceive your performance. 
* Success, however, is a whole different category. It's a collective measure, capturing how people respond to our performance. 
* Success is a collective phenomenon rather than an individual one. 
* Our collective definition of success reminds us that we need to examine the networks we belong to, strategizing how we can use them to our future advantage. 
* Success and fame are very different animals
* And once people become recognizable names outside of their professional networks, to the point that their future performances are secondary to our appreciation of them, we bestow the mantle of fame. 
* The truly famous are those known beyond their local spheres. 
* He useus Wikipedia pages - or to be precise, the number of languages a person's Wikipedia page is published in. 
* **The first law** Performance drives success, but when performance can't be measured, network drives success. 

## Introduction
* Believe it or not, quantitative answers can be found for all these seemingly unquantifiable questions. 
* We puzzle over the fine line between success and failure daily as we envision our own future trajactory or as we steer our children into adulthood. 
* Each  success story is bound to leave a trail of data points behind. 
* A seris of recurring patterns that drive success in most areas of human performance. 
* If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
* Realizing that success is a collective phenomenon throws that perception out the window. 
* to make a discovery with lasting impact, to conduct research so groundbreaking that it couldn't be ignored. 
* But we can use the laws to understand how invisible forces shape our successes and failures.
