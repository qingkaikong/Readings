This will keep the notes from the book I just finish - [The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success](https://www.amazon.com/The-Formula/dp/0316526479/) by Altert-Laszlo Barabasi. 


## Chapter 1
* So they proposed a simple but clever solution. They used Google hits, measuring how many times people searched for these pilots by name on the Internet. 
* At first glance, the Red Baron's legacy confirms the popular assumption that strong performance leads to success. 
* But it's a mere 1.6 percent of the total. Pocket change in the larger scheme. Yet he generated 27 percent of the German aces' Google hits. 
* Seemingly, it's the last person who makes a discovery that really matters, not the first. 
* Your success isn't about you and your performance. It's about us and how we perceive your performance. 
* Success, however, is a whole different category. It's a collective measure, capturing how people respond to our performance. 
* Success is a collective phenomenon rather than an individual one. 
* Our collective definition of success reminds us that we need to examine the networks we belong to, strategizing how we can use them to our future advantage. 
* Success and fame are very different animals
* And once people become recognizable names outside of their professional networks, to the point that their future performances are secondary to our appreciation of them, we bestow the mantle of fame. 
* The truly famous are those known beyond their local spheres. 
* He useus Wikipedia pages - or to be precise, the number of languages a person's Wikipedia page is published in. 
* **The first law** Performance drives success, but when performance can't be measured, network drives success. 

## Introduction
* Believe it or not, quantitative answers can be found for all these seemingly unquantifiable questions. 
* We puzzle over the fine line between success and failure daily as we envision our own future trajactory or as we steer our children into adulthood. 
* Each  success story is bound to leave a trail of data points behind. 
* A seris of recurring patterns that drive success in most areas of human performance. 
* If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
* Realizing that success is a collective phenomenon throws that perception out the window. 
* to make a discovery with lasting impact, to conduct research so groundbreaking that it couldn't be ignored. 
* But we can use the laws to understand how invisible forces shape our successes and failures.
